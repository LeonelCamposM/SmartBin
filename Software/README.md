## Overview
This section will describe the construction process for used software and ML models.

## First Iteration
Used wiring diagram and base code
changed servoPin to 2 (D1 pin xiao-esp32S3)

## Second Iteration
I successfully followed this post to load a custom ML classification model into the GrooveAI V2.

# Structural materials

## Overview
The SmartBin is designed to enhance waste management through automatic classification of electronics waste using a AI Sensor. This STL file outlines the preliminary design and necessary components for the prototype.

## Necessary Components
- **AI Camera**: Detect and classify waste types.
- **Servo Motor**: Places the material in the expected container
- **Microcontroller**: Manage sensor data and motor operations.
- **Power Supply**: Sustain the electronics.
- **Structural Materials**: Build the bin and internal separators.

This file provides a conceptual visualization and identifies the components required for building the SmartBin, aiming to streamline recycling processes.


## First Iterarion
In this iterarion the 3d conceptual model was adapted in order to use a servo motor to handle the material classification.
[ConceptualModel.stl](SmartClassifier.stl)

## Second Iterarion
In this iteration, the laser-cut parts needed for the classification part of the system were completed, and the servo mount now fits in this attempt.

**Designed in ThinkerCaD**

## Third Iterarion
Create my own classification model to classify different kinds of electronic trash and deploy it into the AI vision sensor.
